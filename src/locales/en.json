    "actualAboutText": "Hello, I am currently seeking a junior/internship position. I may have spent too much time working on these portfolio projects rather than focusing on job hunting. I constantly imagine the projects are still incomplete, and it takes months longer to finish the work than intended. Another mistake I've made is not reading enough code, so the code in previous projects was quite unique. Nowadays, I spend part of my day reading code. I am currently examining the source code of the Hibernate library.",
